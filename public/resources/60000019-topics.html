<td>The conquest of Greece by the Homans occurred previous to the coining of King Alpha bodily on earth , and about the time of his coming , they exercised dominion over nearly all nations in the known world , including the Jews , who had been once the favorite regiment of the King of Light ; but because they had in a large degree rebelled against him , and yielded themselves subject to Abadon to obey him , therefore did King Alpha forsake them , and suffered them to fall inte the hands of the Romans , under whose dominion they were at the time of his coining ; as they did not receive him when he came , therefore after he bad been with them long enough to teach them his will concerning them , and they still not obeying , he left them remaining in the hands of the Romans , who held them in servility for a long time , of which we may say more in its proper placo ; but to continuo our remarks on the Homans : this renowned people , after holding dominion over so many nations for a long time , they teo , in their turn , as they did not yield obedienco to the King of Light , were also overthrown , for though they had received so liberally of his bounty , and were indebted to him for all the good things they possessed , yet they , being deceived by Abadon , cleaved more unto him than to the King of Light , who had raised them up from a state of degradation , to a very high and honorable position , but they refused to give that honor to the King of Light that , was due to him .</td>
